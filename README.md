# SQL_Murder_Mystery
In this project, I wore the hat of a detective and was able to uncover the mystery of a murder case where I was able to detect both the murderer and the person who hired the murderer as well. It involved the  analysis of evidence and suspect data to help the police catch the killer in a murder case. Using my  SQL skills, I queried the database to uncover crucial clues and piece together the events surrounding the murder.

The database consisted of four tables:
- Crime Scene Report
- Drivers License
- Facebook Events Check In
- Get Fit Now Check In
- Get Fit Now Member
- Income
- Interview
- Person
- Solution

  
KEY FINDINGS:

From the information given to me by the police, the crime was a murder case which happened on the 15th of January in SQL city.
The major testifiers were Morty Schapiro who lived at 4919 Northwestern Dr, and Annabel Miller who lived at 103 Franklin Avenue.
Both Morty and Annabel had testified separately concerning the murder case, and these testimonies served as clues in uncovering the mystery of this murder case.

CONCLUSION:

Based on the SQL queries and evidence analysis, I have concluded that Jeremy Bowers is the murderer, and Miranda Priestly hired Jeremy Bowers to assassinate the victim

RECOMMENDATION:

I recommend that the police should arrest Jeremy Bowers and Miranda Priestly.
they should also be tried and made to face the law.
